Our objective is to predict whether a male makes more than a female annually,  given the features in the dataset. We’ll be using machine learning prediction models to do so.

Models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest will be used and the model which yields us the best results will be selected and further boosting algorithm i.e. Genetic algorithm will be applied in order to get optimum accuracy. We’ve considered using these 2 ML algorithms as they generally yield the best results for such a dataset as per the research and literature available.
